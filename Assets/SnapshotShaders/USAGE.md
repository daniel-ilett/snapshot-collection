# Snapshot Shader Collection

Thanks for downloading! 

To use Snapshot Shader Collection, attach the `SnapshotMode.cs` script to your scene's main camera.

The example scene demonstrates how the filters appear in practice. You can remove all additional content by deleting the `/SnapshotShaders/Scenes` folder.

To build your game, ensure each of the shaders inside the `/SnapshotShaders/Shaders` folder is included in the "Always Included Shaders" list - you can find it in Project Settings -> Graphics.
